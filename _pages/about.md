I am a postdoctoral research assistant at the University of Oxford in the ultracold quantum matter group, lead by Professor Chris Foot. Here we cool atoms with lasers which can then be used for gravitational wave detection and in the search for ultra-light dark matter.

Passionate about physics, education and outreach I have worked as a tutor for a number of the Oxford colleges, been heavily involved in undergraduate admissions, and have a post as an academic at a local secondary school. I have delivered numerous outreach talks on physics as an EPSRC's Quantum Ambassador, as well as talks to school students encouraging university applications.
